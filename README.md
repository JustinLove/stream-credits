# StreamCredits


## Compiling

Built using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

My build command:

> `elm make src/StreamCredits.elm --output public/stream-credits.js`

`bin/monitor.bat` has a command using the [watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watch) CLI

Once built, `public/index.html` can be opened locally from the filesystem, or set up for a local or internet server as you wish.
